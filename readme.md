**MD simulations**

In the MIDSTlab we primarily use VMD/NAMD suite of programs to carry out MD simulations, trajectory visualization and basic analyses. Therefore, you are expected to follow and complete VMD & NAMD tutorials at http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Training/Tutorials/ ( ‘using VMD’ and ‘NAMD tutorial’ are sufficient for beginners; however, please do not skip any steps; they come back to haunt you. Also, the theoretical information given in boxes is absolutely necessary).

To make sure you have a smooth environment for running on your own computer, follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/midstlab/Welcome_pack_for_MIDSTLab/blob/main/Midst_guide.pdf)  

**Molecular graphics**

MIDSTlab primarily uses VMD and ChimeraX for visualizing the molecules of interest. You have already learned about VMD in the previous step. For ChimeraX, do this [tutorial](https://github.com/midstlab/Welcome_pack_for_MIDSTLab/blob/main/ChimeraX_handson.pdf)


**How to run an MD simulation on TRUBA and ToSUn servers?**

For starters, familiarize yourself with basic unix commands. Here is a nice starter kit: [https://www.math.utah.edu/lab/unix/unix-commands.html]

**How to get access to servers?**

Lab computers: all computers have the same username/password; please contact any current member of the lab for initial instructions on how to use them and allocations.

ToSUn: request from your mentor to e-mail mdbf.hpc-support@sabanciuniv.edu

TRUBA: with your mentor cc'd, e-mail to grid-teknik@ulakbim.gov.tr


**Connection to TRUBA :** 

To learn how to connect to TRUBA and submit jobs, follow the guidance [here](https://github.com/midstlab/Welcome_pack_for_MIDSTLab/blob/main/Midst_guide.pdf)

 For batch run preparation [follow this repository](https://github.com/midstlab/md_simulation_run)
